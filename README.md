Pre Proposal:

Name of Project: Pass A Note

Brief Proposal: Pass A Note and app that solves a major problem most college students have: missing class and needing to borrow notes. With this app users will be able to add, edit and delete notes, upload pictures, add classmates and rate their classmates notes.

:: Landing Page
Upon login a user will be directed to their landing (home) page.

:: Notebooks
Upon login a user will be able to see their individual class notebooks that contain notes for that specific class subject.

:: Search
Upon login a user will be able to search for their fellow classmates, “follow” them, view their notes and rate them

:: Tasks and Dates
Upon login a user will be able to add important dates and tasks.

:: Sessions Storage
Using session storage to mimic multiple users using the site concurrently.

Final Proposal:
Initial ERD
